# DimensionalityReduction-and-UnSupervised-Learning
The following notebooks dives into the MNIST data set.

    This work involves using dimensionality reduction on the MNIST dataset.
    It extends to using Semi-Supervised Learning, and obtains a 98% accuracy
    score on just labelling 50 instances - a jump of 10% in accuracy from
    the previous unlabelled instances. 
    
    The notebook does not extend to Active Learning but I will be adding that in
    down the road.
