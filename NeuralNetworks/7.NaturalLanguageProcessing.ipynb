        "- Assuming that your data is a **Stationary** time series (i.e. the mean, variance and autocorrelation does not change). This assumption works well for most time series data but some time series data has disappearing patterns over time. In these scenarios we would benefit by training the data on short time spans. You can plot the model's error on the validation set, and if you observe increasing errors towards the end of the data then you know the data is not stationary enough.\n",
